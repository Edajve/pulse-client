# Pulse Mobile Client

This is a React Native mobile client for Pulse.

## Expo App

This project is built using Expo, a platform for building and deploying universal React applications. It simplifies the process of developing React Native apps by providing tools and services that streamline development and allow for rapid iteration.

### Dependencies

To set up the project environment, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/): Command-line tool for creating, managing, and publishing Expo projects.
- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/routing/): A routing library for React Native applications.
- [React Native Safe Area Context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context): A React Native library that provides a SafeAreaView component for rendering content within safe areas of the screen.
- [React Native Screens](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens): An optimized screen component library for React Native.
- [Expo Linking](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/linking/): A module for handling deep linking in Expo apps.
- [Expo Constants](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/constants/): A module that provides system information and various device constants.
- [Expo Status Bar](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/status-bar/): A module for controlling the appearance of the status bar in Expo apps.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
